# Drowsiness_Detector
This Flask app detects drowsiness using real-time face and eye detection via OpenCV. If the user blinks multiple times in quick succession, an alarm sound is triggered as a wake-up notification. This project is part of FlaskLab by Vaibhav, a series of Python Flask-based web apps focused on building fun, useful, and creative applications.
